client/server

The client and server are the two main components of socket programming. The client is a computer/node that request for the service and the server is a computer/ node that response to the client. In Java, using socket programming, we can connect the client and server.

A socket is an endpoint for sending and receiving messages. It is a combination of IP address and port number. There are two types of sockets used in a client-server program: one is a client socket, and another is a server socket. The client, in a client-server program, must know the whereabouts of the endpoint (IP address and port number) of the server, where the client wants to send the request for a service. In the computer world, both client and server are application programs. A server program uses a server socket, whereas a client program uses a client socket for communication.
